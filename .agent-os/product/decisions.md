## 2025-01-08: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Develop **Intelligent SERP API** as a self-hosted Google search proxy specializing in business intelligence pattern recognition. Focus on Instagram business discovery workflows with automated similar account finding through content analysis and parallel search execution.

### Context

Need for reliable, self-controlled Google search infrastructure combined with intelligent pattern recognition for business discovery. Current solutions lack workflow automation for complex research tasks like finding similar businesses based on bio content analysis.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **SaaS Search API Service**
   - Pros: No infrastructure management, faster setup
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, data privacy concerns, limited customization

2. **Basic Proxy Without Intelligence**  
   - Pros: Simple implementation, lower complexity
   - Cons: Manual workflow processes, no competitive advantage

3. **AI-Powered Search Platform**
   - Pros: Advanced capabilities, market differentiation
   - Cons: High complexity, external AI dependencies, cost concerns

### Rationale

Self-hosted approach provides data privacy, infrastructure control, and customization freedom required for specialized business intelligence workflows. Focus on workflow automation and pattern recognition creates clear value differentiation from basic search proxies.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over search infrastructure and data privacy
- Unique workflow strategies provide competitive advantage
- Modular architecture enables future integration with other systems
- Specialized Instagram business discovery addresses specific market need

**Negative:**
- Infrastructure maintenance responsibility
- Higher initial development complexity
- Self-hosting requirements may limit some users

## 2025-01-08: Technology Stack Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use FastAPI + Crawl4ai + Bright Data combination for core infrastructure. Implement Redis caching, avoid database dependencies in initial phases, use Streamlit for prototyping.

### Context

Need reliable, high-performance stack supporting async operations, content analysis, and proxy integration while maintaining simplicity for rapid development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Scrapy + Custom Proxy**
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, built-in admin
   - Cons: Slower async support, heavier framework

2. **Node.js + Puppeteer + Proxy Service**
   - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem, browser automation
   - Cons: Less Python ecosystem integration, memory usage

### Rationale

FastAPI provides excellent async support and auto-documentation. Crawl4ai offers advanced content extraction capabilities. Bright Data ensures reliable proxy infrastructure. This combination optimizes for performance while maintaining development velocity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High performance async operations
- Advanced content extraction capabilities  
- Reliable proxy infrastructure
- Rapid development and testing cycles

**Negative:**
- Python ecosystem dependency
- Learning curve for Crawl4ai integration

## 2025-01-08: Modular Architecture Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Integration Team

### Decision

Design as standalone API module without database, frontend, or deployment dependencies. Prepare integration interfaces for future database and frontend modules.

### Context

Product will be integrated with other development projects requiring clean module separation and flexible integration patterns.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Full-Stack Application**
   - Pros: Single deployment, integrated development
   - Cons: Tight coupling, difficult integration

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Ultimate flexibility, independent scaling
   - Cons: Deployment complexity, inter-service communication overhead

### Rationale

Modular approach balances integration flexibility with development simplicity. Clean API boundaries enable future integration while maintaining focus on core search intelligence functionality.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clean integration with future modules
- Focused development on core competencies
- Flexible deployment options
- Reduced initial complexity

**Negative:**
- Integration testing requires coordination
- API contract discipline required

## 2025-01-08: Company Analysis & Employee Discovery Expansion

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team, Future Integration Partners

### Decision

Expand **Intelligent SERP API** to include comprehensive company analysis capabilities with automated employee discovery through multi-page Streamlit interface and dedicated API endpoints.

### Context

User requirement for company intelligence workflows that bridge Instagram business discovery with detailed company analysis including website crawling and employee identification. Need for seamless workflow navigation and automated research pipelines.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate Company Analysis Application**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, independent development
   - Cons: Workflow fragmentation, duplicate infrastructure, integration complexity

2. **Basic Company Search Only**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, reduced scope
   - Cons: Limited value add, doesn't address employee discovery needs

3. **Full LinkedIn Integration Immediately**
   - Pros: Complete solution, comprehensive data
   - Cons: Third-party API dependency, increased complexity and cost

### Rationale

Integrated approach maintains workflow continuity while expanding value proposition. Phased implementation (website crawling first, LinkedIn integration later) manages complexity while providing immediate value. Multi-page Streamlit architecture enables seamless user experience.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Comprehensive business intelligence pipeline from Instagram discovery to employee analysis
- Seamless workflow navigation enhances user experience
- Architecture prepared for future LinkedIn API integration
- Expanded market positioning as complete business research platform

**Negative:**
- Increased system complexity requiring additional testing
- Employee discovery algorithms require development and validation
- Multi-page architecture adds interface management overhead
